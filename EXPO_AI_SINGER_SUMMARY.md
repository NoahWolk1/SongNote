# Expo AI Singer Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
Successfully ported the web app's "songs" feature to the Expo native app with full AI singing functionality, making it work identically to the localhost web app.

## âœ… What Was Accomplished

### 1. **Complete UI/UX Redesign for Mobile**
- **Songs Dashboard**: List view with song cards, delete functionality, empty state
- **Create Song Screen**: Lyrics-first approach with large editable text area
- **Song Details Screen**: Full-screen lyrics editing, playback controls, regeneration
- **Navigation**: Complete navigation stack with proper TypeScript typing

### 2. **AI Singing Integration**
- **Convex AI Singer**: Mathematical synthesis running directly in Convex actions
- **No External Dependencies**: Eliminated need for external AI backends
- **Real-time Generation**: Songs generated instantly with speech-like singing
- **Pitch Control**: Adjustable voice pitch (-12 to +12 semitones)
- **Style Options**: Pop, ballad, jazz with mood variations

### 3. **Key Features Implemented**
- **Auto-save**: Lyrics saved automatically while typing and on screen exit
- **Regeneration**: One-tap song regeneration with current lyrics/settings
- **Audio Playback**: Built-in audio player with play/stop controls
- **Settings Modal**: Voice style, mood, pitch, and music options
- **Change Detection**: Visual indicators when unsaved changes exist

### 4. **Technical Architecture**
- **Convex Backend**: All AI logic runs in Convex actions
- **Mathematical Synthesis**: Pure JavaScript audio generation
- **Base64 Audio**: WAV format audio returned as base64 strings
- **Real-time Updates**: Live data synchronization across devices

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Core Files Modified/Created:

#### Navigation & Screens
- `apps/native/src/navigation/Navigation.tsx` - Complete navigation stack
- `apps/native/src/screens/SongsDashboardScreen.tsx` - Song list with CRUD
- `apps/native/src/screens/CreateSongScreen.tsx` - Song creation with AI
- `apps/native/src/screens/SongDetailsScreen.tsx` - Full editing & playback

#### Backend (Convex)
- `packages/backend/convex/ai_singer.ts` - AI singing synthesis engine
- `packages/backend/convex/songs.ts` - Song management mutations/actions
- `packages/backend/convex/schema.ts` - Database schema with pitch field

### AI Singing Engine Features:
- **Word-based Synthesis**: Each word gets specific frequency mapping
- **Speech-like Sounds**: Harmonics, formants, and noise for clarity
